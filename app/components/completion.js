        <strong>What was the purpose of this study?</strong>
        <p>This study aimed to understand how people learn about, make sense of, and predict other peopleâ€™s personality traits,
         mental states, actions, and social situations. You may not have seen all of these types of information, but across
          participants we presented each different type through a variety of different stimuli, including images, videos,
           audio, and text. We will analyze the responses that you provided to shed light on how the mind organizes social knowledge.
        </p>

        <strong>What were our hypotheses?</strong>
        <p>
        We hypothesize that the mind organizes social knowledge in a way that is both efficient, and useful for prediction. 
        In this context, efficiency means reducing the complexity of the social world down to a simple yet accurate summary. 
        Social prediction includes predicting how other people will think, feel, and behave in the future, based on what you 
        know about them in the past and present. We believe that these two goals of efficiency and prediction shape the way that 
        people understand their social world.
        </p>

        <strong>How was this study conducted?</strong>
        <p>
        During the study, you viewed and judged a variety of stimuli and rated their social properties. We will analyze these 
        data to determine the underlying principles that organize and explain your judgements. This will reveal dimensions and
         process that shape social thought.
        </p>

        <strong>Did we tell you everything?</strong>
        <p>
        There was no deception used in this study. Our initial description of the study was brief to avoid biasing your natural 
        responses. We are thus here providing you with a more detailed explanation of the study.
        </p>

        <strong>Why is this study important?</strong>
        <p>
        This study aims to understand the social knowledge people use to navigate everyday social life. The way that people's minds 
        organize that social knowledge may help explain a wide range of important behaviors. For example, some social biases are 
        thought to arise in part because the mind oversimplifies aspects of the social world. If we can understand how these processes 
        play out, we may learn to more accurately predict and change them.
